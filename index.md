## About me

It is my pleasure to meet you here. I am **Zhang Zhaoji(张兆骥 in Simplified Chinese)**, an undergraduate at Peking University, majoring in Chemical Biology with a double major in Intelligence Science and Technology(which is AI major's old name). My curiosity about Neuroscience, especially circuit, computation, and system neuroscience, has led me to be an intern at [Yatang-Li's Lab](https://yatanglilab.cibr.ac.cn/en/) at the Chinese Institute for Brain Research, Beijing (CIBR, Beijing).

I am going to (though not officially documented) the Center of Life Science(CLS)@PKU-THU to persuit my PhD in Integrated Life Science in 2025 Fall. Hope we would have a great time there.

[My former_academic transcript](https://1drv.ms/b/s!Ah_4_Sy2JGNygSQ7jt_fCIdXzE2-?e=GE2ChP) is available for a deeper look into my academic journey, and you can find my research profile on [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0009-0002-3293-1961). Since the transcript is slightly outdated currently you may directly ask me for a newer version.

For regular communication, please contact me through my student email: **zhang-zj@stu.pku.edu.cn** (Checking my student email is one of my daily routine). In case you want to contact me when our server being shutdown(may happen 1~10 times per year), Here is my personal e-mail address: zhang_zhaoji@foxmail.com (usually I would check it once per week or month, but not ensured).

## Research Interests

- **Neuroscience** Saliency Detection & Perception, Visual Encoding&Decoding, BMI/BCI
- **Computer Vision:** Saliency Detection, Video Saliency Detection
- Recently I have learned some basic electronic skills including Arduino, Soldering and PCB. Maybe I would put them into use in our lab in the future. Molecular Biology (also organic chemistry) experiments are always boring, time consuming and Programmatic for human experimenters. What if we do a little coding here?

## News

- We have published our research about Saliency Detection in mouse Superior Colliculus(SC) Recently on **Communications Biology** in the name of [Preference-independent saliency map in the mouse superior colliculus](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-025-08006-x). I would say it is a underrated decision because saliency detection is such an important problem and mouse SC may give us a alternative way to think about it, in another way besides triditional Zhaoping's V1 Saliency hypothesis.

- I am going to graduate from PKU in 2025/07/01.
